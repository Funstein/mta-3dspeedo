MTA 3D Speedometer
=============
3D speedometer resource for MTA San Andreas.

Features
--------
Get in a vehicle to start the speedometer. It will start displaying your vehicle health, nitro status and speed right next to the driver's door.

If you're having issues with the 3D display or are more used to the (pointless) imperial system, use /speedo in order to call up the speedometer settings GUI.

Todo
--------
* Fully implement the settings UI
* Add a better implementation for the nitrous-infinite permission

Known Bugs
--------
* The nitrous controls may bug out, I'm working on this.
* The location determination code doesn't work properly on planes. This will be fixed when vehicle components arrive.
