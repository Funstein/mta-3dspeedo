MTA 3D Speedometer
=============
3D speedometer resource for MTA San Andreas.

Features
--------
Get in a vehicle to start the speedometer. It will start displaying your vehicle health, nitro status and speed right next to the driver's door.

Teams listed in the script file are entitled to infinite NOS on every NOS-armed vehicle they board.

If you want to switch to the (pointless) imperial system, use the command /speedounit
If for some reason you lack visual taste and would like to use a 2d speedometer, use the command /speedotype

Todo
--------
* Implement a settings GUI
* Consider better implementations of the nitrous-infinite permission system
* Rewrite the unit/type settings code

Known Bugs
--------
* The nitrous controls may bug out, I'm working on this.
* The location determination code doesn't work properly on planes. This will be fixed when vehicle components arrive.
